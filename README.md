# CoinMarketCap Exchange Rates plugin

Use shortcodes **[exchange-rates]** and **[exchange-history]** in any part of a page to call plugin interface.

**Due to the limitations of the CoinMarketCap free API plan, only BTC conversion is available and only 100 currencies**, but the plugin makes it easy to enable the conversion of all currencies with a little code refinement.

**The plugin interface contains minimal design**, but it is easy to customize using CSS for the tasks of a particular project.

**This is very basic plugin implementation.** No external libraries (CSS, JS, etc. ) used in this plugin.
